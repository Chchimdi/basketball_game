This is a Python program that simulates a basketball shooting game for a local high school.
The game supports 2 players, with each player attempting to score as many points as possible by making shots from 5 fixed shooting positions.

At each shooting position, there is a rack of 5 basketballs. Out of the 5 balls, the first 4 are regular balls, worth 1 point each. The 5th ball, often nicknamed the "money ball", is worth 2 points. The “money ball” can only be shot after the 4 regular balls are shot.

Of those 5 positions, the player can choose a position to have a rack consisting only of "money balls", which are all worth 2 points. This position is called “money-ball rack”.

The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible. Player 1 needs to finish shooting from all 5 positions before Player 2 shoots. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner. If the 2 players have the same score, then it is a tie game.

After the game is completed, the players will have the option to play again or quit. The program should run until being asked to quit.
